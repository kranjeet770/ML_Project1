Creating a Regressive predictive model for Counterfeit Medicines Sales data with machine learning algorithms using Python
I got Counterfeit Medicines Sales data which contains several attributes. As it was not fit for directly creating predictive model from this,
i have to make it to go through data preprocessing process.
after that i applied all machine learning algorithms for predictive model and then check each for its tentetive performance.
